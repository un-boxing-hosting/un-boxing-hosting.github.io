<p>DrogoBot is a bot that is always updating!</p>
<p>DrogoBot based off the concept of un-boxing-bot and is managed by the same people.</p>
<p>DrogoBot is a manifestation of all of our ideas for a bot in one bot.</p>
<p>Everything within the bot is meant to help others on discord, whether it's to help the admins of a server with managing the server, or a normal person to have fun with it.</p> 
<p>It's very multipurpose.</p>
